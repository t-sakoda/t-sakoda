# 👋 Hello, I'm t-sakoda – a Co-engineer

I believe engineers don't grow alone.

Through quiet collaboration and shared rhythm,  
I help others discover their hidden strengths —  
not by leading, but by *playing alongside*.

> Like a jazz session: no hierarchy, just harmony.

## 🌱 What is a Co-engineer?

A Co-engineer is:

- Not a mentor  
- Not a coach  
- But a **companion** in code and growth

Even without saying much,  
you might hear someone say:  
_"Somehow, I always grow when working with them."_

That's the kind of presence I aim to be —  
a quiet supporter who helps others shine.

It’s about the right effort.”_
